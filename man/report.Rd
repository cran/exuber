\title{Report summary statistics, diagnostics and date stamping periods of mildly explosive behaviour.}
\usage{
report(x, y)

diagnostics(x, y, option = c("gsadf", "sadf"))

datestamp(x, y, option = c("gsadf", "sadf"), min_duration = 0)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{An object of class \code{\link[=radf]{radf()}}.}

\item{y}{An object, which is the output of \code{\link[=mc_cv]{mc_cv()}} or
\code{\link[=wb_cv]{wb_cv()}}.}

\item{option}{Whether to apply the "gsadf" or "sadf" methodology. Default is
"gsadf".}

\item{min_duration}{The minimum duration of an explosive period for it to be
reported. Default is 0.}
}
\value{
Returns a list of values for each explosive sub-period, giving the
origin and termination dates as well as the number of periods explosive
behavior lasts.
}
\description{
Report summary statistics, diagnostics and date stamping periods of mildly explosive behaviour.
}
\details{
Setting \code{min_duration} allows temporary spikes above the critical value
sequence to be removed. Phillips et al. (2015) propose a simple way to remove
small periods of explosiveness by a rule of thumb such as "log(T)" or
"log(T)/T", where T is the number of observations.

\section{Functions}{
\itemize{
\item \code{report}: Returns a list of summary statistics for the t-statistic
and the critical values of the ADF, SADF and GSADF.

\item \code{diagnostics}: Finds the series that reject the null for 95\%
significance level.

\item \code{datestamp}: Computes the origination, termination and duration of episodes during which
the time series display explosive dynamics.
}}

\examples{
\donttest{
# Simulate bubble processes, compute the t-stat and critical values
set.seed(4441)
dta <- cbind(sim_dgp1(n = 100), sim_dgp2(n = 100))
rfd <- radf(dta)
mc <- mc_cv(n = 100)

# Report, diagnostics and datestamp (default)
report(x = rfd, y = mc)
diagnostics(x = rfd, y = mc)
datestamp(x = rfd, y = mc)

# Diagnostics for 'sadf'
diagnostics(x = rfd, y = mc, option = "sadf")

# Use rule of thumb to omit periods of explosiveness which are short-lived
rot = round(log(NROW(rfd)))
datestamp(x = rfd, y = mc, min_duration = rot)
